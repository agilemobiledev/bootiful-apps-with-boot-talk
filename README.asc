# Building "Bootiful" Applications with Spring Boot


This is the code from my http://jaxlondon.com/2014/sessions/bootiful-code-spring-boot[JAX London 2014] talk - a refresh on the classic 'Bootiful' talk.

This had one slide (which you don't need), and this code.

The code demonstrates (via Spring Boot):

  * Spring Social
  * Spring Data MongoDB
  * Spring MVC
  * Spring Data REST (and Spring's REST support)
  * Spring Boot's actuator framework
  * how to build operations-friendly Spring Boot applications
